Types
====

* Constructors and static methods
* Methods
* Implementing traits
* Defining traits
* Polymorphic functions
* Extension methods

Traits can have default implementations and can inherit from other traits. Like Java 8 interfaces or Scala traits.

Enums can have just members, or members can have values, tuples or (experimentally) structs associated with members. Handy with match blocks.

Visibility is per module.
