Get Started
===========

Download and install a recent Rust
I used a nightly from 4th July, shortly after 0.11. Other versions may or may not compile. Fun!

Syntax highlighting is available in all major editors and Emacs.

Clone this repository. Preferably a branch without the answers.

Some basic syntax
=================

Compile tests with
rustc --test main.rs
This will produce an executable called rust-dojo. Run it to run the tests.

Complete functions/mod.rs to make the tests pass!
